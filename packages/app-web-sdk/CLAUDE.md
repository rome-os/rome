# `@rome-os/app-web-sdk`

The web runtime SDK apps import, plus the `rome` CLI (`bin/rome.js` → `src/cli/`): `dev` and `build` for the app web bundle; `create`, `validate`, and `run` for developing an app outside Rome; and the Rome App Store commands `login`, `whoami`, and `publish` under `src/cli/store/`.

`validate` and `run` reuse the host's own code instead of restating it. `validate` packs through `@rome-os/app-runtime/packaging`, the module the daemon installs with. `run` wires the app through `@rome-os/app-runtime/testing`. `run` mounts the UI the way `packages/web/src/components/rome-app-host.tsx` does, with the dashboard's theme values copied into `assets/host-themes.css`. `packages/web/src/lib/host-themes-css.test.ts` fails when that copy drifts. Run it with `UPDATE_HOST_THEMES=1` to rewrite the copy. `create` copies `packages/app-template/template`, which `prepack` bundles under `templates/app`.

## Styling contract

Color and shadow values vary with theme and mode. The host owns them, and an app inherits them across the shadow boundary. [`@rome-os/ui/styles.css`](../ui/src/styles.css) holds the full list: the names its `@theme inline` block reads but never declares.

Everything else is local. The app's own bundle supplies it, through the imports in [`src/runtime/styles.css`](src/runtime/styles.css).

`@rome-os/ui` is an **optional peer**, not a dependency. The app declares the kit, so the components it imports and the canon that dresses them resolve to the same install — a version skew between the two cannot arise. Optional, because an app can use the SDK runtime and never import its stylesheet. An app that does import it and omits the kit fails to resolve `@rome-os/ui/styles.css`, which is the loud version of the skew it replaces.

## Traps

**The store commands talk to a service, and the user-facing name is the store.** CLI output, help text, and docs say "Rome App Store", never the name of the service hosting it. Nothing checks this.
